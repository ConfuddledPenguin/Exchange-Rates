Exchange Rates
=========

###Description##

This was a project for the class CS317 at the university of Strathclyde. The class focuses on mobile development and the issues it creates in terms of user interaction. It is more about the design rather than development, hence the web app.

This project is a simple rates calculator for currency. It uses rates from the ECB (European Central Bank) to calculate the exchange. 

For this project we where required to not use any frameworks, e.g. JQuery Mobile

Due to other projects this is not quite complete. With some html elements still being visible, hopefully I shall get some time to come back and finish it.
